This is a mini version of the game "liar's dice", from the movie Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest.
The goal of the game is to guess how many of a certain dice are at the table. Davy will give a bluff or real answer, and the player must determine if he's lying by looking at their own dice.
The player is guessing if the number of the dice is higher, lower, or equal to what davy says.
