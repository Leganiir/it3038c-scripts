Needed packages:

pip install requests

pip install tkinter

Then just run in python IDE

Orginal idea was from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/currency-converter-in-python/
I have changed the currencies that it converts, and connected it to an API, while the website linked just using a python tool.

I thought this project would be useful because in media I watch I often find different currencies being used without conversion to USD being given for context. I thought it would be handy to have my own application so I can do those conversions.
